# Search Engine Implementation

The new Google?

Not quite. 

However, this code does do the following: 

 - implements a basic a search engine
 - displays search results in a browser window
 - allows navigation to documents

The final result looks like:
![search page](./search-page.png)
![search file page](./search-file-page.png)

The actual search mechanism of the code is three parts:

1. Linear search
2. Hashtable via built in Python dict objects
3. Hashtable that I custom implemented

This is to show that linear search perfomance is far worse than hashtable searching.

This code was revisited and the hashtables were implemented in an object-oriented manner in this repo: https://github.com/loulai/object-oriented-hashtable
